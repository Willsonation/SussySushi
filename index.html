    	<p class="foodSample">“As a single parent I like my children to have variety in their food choices but I don’t have a lot of time. I also don’t have a big budget. I also want to make sure that they are eating healthy. I have been coming to the sushi bar at my Crystal Lake market for a year. I love my chef, the sushi selection (Dragon Roll…mmmm) and the price. My kids love it because they feel it shows they have style. It’s a win all-around!”</p>
