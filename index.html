            <p class="foodSample">This is the first stop on our tour of the Charlie Fan Club museum. The photographer has chosen to remain unnamed. Here we can see Charlie in his natural habitat sitting on the ground. He is wearing his classic blue jacket, so we know this is a real candid shot.</p>

            <p class="foodSample">This exibit depicts Charlie after a horrible car axident. Unfortunately he lost an eye, but he grew it back so he's alright now. Charlie has gone through some rough patches while learning to drive, but it's almost safe to go back on the roads again so he must be getting better.</p>

    	<p class="foodSample">“As a single parent I like my children to have variety in their food choices but I don’t have a lot of time. I also don’t have a big budget. I also want to make sure that they are eating healthy. I have been coming to the sushi bar at my Crystal Lake market for a year. I love my chef, the sushi selection (Dragon Roll…mmmm) and the price. My kids love it because they feel it shows they have style. It’s a win all-around!”</p>
